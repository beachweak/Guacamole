### What is Guacamole?

Guacamole is an open-sourced Python based 3D shape viewer.

In it's basic form, Guacamole allows you to rotate & zoom different 3D shapes. A console is also available, allowing for customisation (such as color of the shape & background, size of the shapes, etc).

Current features:
- Five different shapes; Cube, Sphere, Cone, Cylinder and Pyramid.
- Hex code color support, while also allowing for basic colors (such as red or white)
- Background + shape coloring support via console
- XYZ rotation of shapes using the mouse

Guacamole utilises [Pyglet](https://pyglet.org/) for most of the 3D handling. Guacamole is compiled with [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller).
